**YouTube Studio Assistant** is a powerful browser extension designed to save you time, break creative blocks, and help you reach a global audience. It integrates directly into your existing YouTube Studio dashboard, providing a suite of AI tools right where you need them.

## Core Features: A Deeper Dive

Our goal is to provide creators with a powerful, flexible, and intuitive toolkit. Here’s a detailed look at our main features.

### 🤖 Feature 1: AI Content Generator

Beat writer's block forever. Generate high-quality, SEO-optimized metadata for your videos in seconds. Our AI Content Generator helps you craft compelling titles, detailed descriptions, and relevant tags that capture viewer attention and improve discoverability.

- **Multiple AI Providers**: You're in control. Choose the AI model that best fits your needs and budget. We support:
  - **Google Gemini**: Leverage Google's powerful and often free-tier models for excellent results.
  - **OpenAI GPT**: Access the world-renowned GPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.) with your own API key.
  - **DeepSeek**: Utilize cost-effective and powerful models for efficient content creation.
- **Customizable Output**: Tailor the AI's tone and style to perfectly match your channel's brand voice.
- **Instant Inspiration**: Generate multiple variations to find the perfect hook for your next viral video.

- **Native Dark Mode**: Automatically syncs with YouTube Studio's dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience, day or night.
